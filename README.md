## 📝 Project Descriptions

### 1️⃣ Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction (Logistic Regression)

**File:** `BankMarketingLogisticRegression.ipynb`\
**Description:** This project uses a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing campaign data.

#### 📊 Dataset:

- Source: Kaggle Machine Learning Repository (Bank Marketing Dataset)
- Features include age, job type, marital status, education, and previous campaign interactions.

#### 📌 Techniques Used:

- Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression Model
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve)

#### 🚀 How to Run:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/AI-Projects.git
   cd AI-Projects
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run `BankMarketingLogisticRegression.ipynb`
